some useful scripts related to zfs

snapspace takes a filesystem as an argument, and reports how much data referenced by this snapshot is not in the filesystem (as OLDREFS), the amount of that data that exists only in this snapshot (as UNIQUE, equal to the zfs "used" property), and the percentage of the old data that this unique data represents.

Sample output:

SNAPSHOT                                    OLDREFS   UNIQUE    UNIQUE%
zfs-auto-snap_monthly-2014-05-09-17h07        8.53T     8.51T    99%
zfs-auto-snap_monthly-2014-06-09-17h07      368.94G   341.41G    92%
zfs-auto-snap_weekly-2014-07-07-17h07       677.10G    14.67G     2%
zfs-auto-snap_monthly-2014-07-09-17h09      676.68G    14.37G     2%

snapreport takes a snapshot with filesystem as an argument, and shows ONLY the data in this snapshot that the previous snapshot doesn't contain (if this is the oldest snapshot, all data in the snapshot), and for each snapshot (and the filesystem) that shares some of this data, it displays how much data is shared up to that snapshot and no further, suppressing lines with a zero value for other snapshots (but uses "unique" to mean "deleted before the next snapshot", and "active" to mean "has not been deleted").

Sample output:

ENDING SNAPSHOT                             SIZE
unique                                        8.51T
